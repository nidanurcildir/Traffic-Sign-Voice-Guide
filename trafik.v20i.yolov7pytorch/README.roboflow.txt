The dataset includes 809 images.
Kirmizi-sari-yesil-yaya are annotated in YOLO v7 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 5 and 12 percent of the image
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -15 and +15 percent
